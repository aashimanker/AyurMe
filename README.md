## Dosha Quiz Functionality

AyurMe includes a Dosha Quiz to determine the userâ€™s dominant dosha (Kapha, Pitta, or Vata) based on their characteristics and preferences. Here's how it works:

1. **Definition of Dosha Characteristics**  
   Each dosha (Kapha, Pitta, Vata) has predefined characteristics stored in an object.

2. **Characteristics Counting**  
   - User answers are stored in an object.
   - The system checks each answer against dosha characteristics and increments the count for matching doshas.

3. **Finding the Dominant Dosha**  
   - Determine which dosha has the highest count.
   - Update the result dynamically based on the user's responses.

4. **Setting the Result**  
   The dominant dosha is displayed to the user, along with personalized recommendations.
